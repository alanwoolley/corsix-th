This document describes a rudimentary test procedure used before
all major releases.

Operating Systems that should be checked if possible:
 Windows 8
 Windows 7
 Windows Vista
 Windows XP
 Ubuntu
 Mac OS X Snow Leopard
 Mac OS X Mountain Lion


Save games should be named after their issue number if they
come from a specific issue on the Google Project site.
e.g. "issue 1119.sav". If it doesn't come from a specific issue,
a descriptive name is needed.
Add enough information in the "specific issue" section in this
document to check that the bug isn't reintroduced.
